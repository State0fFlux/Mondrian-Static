# Mondrian-Static
I developed an interactive random art generator using recursion. It creates geometric patterns inspired by Piet Mondrian, as well as more complex, stylized variants resembling static or waveforms. The project demonstrates algorithmic design, procedural generation, and randomness, showcasing my skills in recursion and dynamic pattern creation.
